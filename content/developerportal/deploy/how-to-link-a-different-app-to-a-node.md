## 1 Introduction

This how-to describes linking a **different app** to your **licensed cloud node** so that you can deploy a different app.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

*  Link a different app to your node which already has a linked an app
*  Exchange apps between two nodes

## 2 Prerequisites

Before you can start with this how-to, please make sure you have completed the following prerequisites.

* Be the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/company-app-roles/technical-contact) of the node

If you have created an app in the **Mendix Modeler**, you can upload it to the **Team Server** (see [Upload To Version Control Dialog](/refguide/upload-to-version-control-dialog)) and a repository will be created automatically.

*   Make sure no environments are linked to your app. (Every **Team Server** app is linked to a **Sandbox** automatically).
Instructions on how to do this are in [How To Unlink Your Free App from a Sandbox Environment](how-to-unlink-sandbox).

## 3 Linking a App to a Licensed Cloud Node

Read [How to Deploy to the Mendix Cloud](mendix-cloud-deploy) to learn how to link an app to a cloud node.

## 4 Linking a Different App to the Node

1.  In the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com), go to **Apps** and select the *app* you want to link to the *node*.
2.  Once you are in the *app*, go to the **'Environments'** tab in the left navigation panel.
3.  Click **Select a Node**.
4.  Select the correct *node* by clicking **Use this Node** and link it to your *app*. *The current linked app will be unlinked automatically*.

## 5 Exchange Linked Apps Between Nodes

If you want to swap the nodes of two apps which are already linked to these nodes, you can create a new (third) app.

For example, take the following case:

**App A** is on **Node 1**

**App B** is on **Node 2**

To link **App A** to **Node 2** and **App B** to **Node 1**, follow these steps:

1. Create a new empty app **App C** which is not connected to any environment.

2. Link **App C** to **Node 1** (see [3.1 Method 1 in *How To Link Your Free App to a Licensed Cloud Node*](how-to-link-app-to-node)). This will unlink **App A**.

3. Now that **App A** is unlinked from **Node 1**, it can be linked to **Node 2** (see [3.2 Method 2 in *How To Link Your Free App to a Licensed Cloud Node*](how-to-link-app-to-node)).

4. **App B** will now no longer have a node. You can link **App B** to **Node 1** by following [3.2 Method 2 in *How To Link Your Free App to a Licensed Cloud Node*](how-to-link-app-to-node).
