With Mendix, you can make use of the fully integrated feedback cycle functionality. Mendix supports enabling the end-user to provide feedback out of the box. This feedback is then reviewed, processed, and converted into actionable [user stories](../collaborate/stories).

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Use the widget for leaving feedback on an app
* Configure the Widget

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Create an app containing a working application model

## 3 Submitting Feedback on an App

The main purpose of the Mendix Feedback widget is to enable app end-users to provide feedback on apps. By just clicking **Feedback** when you are logged in to a Mendix app, you can comment on low-priority issues, ask questions, and propose ideas for improvement. That feedback is then reviewed and processed. For details on how feedback is addressed for an app project, see [Feedback Management](index).

Via the Feedback Widget, you can also also provide feedback on how various parts of the Mendix Platform are working, such as the [Developer Portal](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html), [App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html), [Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/index4.html), [Academy](https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/home), and [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/). However, note that the **Feedback** button is not a support option. If there are real platform problems, please contact [Mendix Support](http://support.mendix.com).

To provide feedback via the Mendix Feedback Widget, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Feedback** button on the right-side of the screen.
2. Fill in the feedback you want to send to Mendix. The feedback can be an **Issue**, **Idea**, or **Question**. A description of the feedback (in **Additional information**) and a screenshot of the screen (via the **Include a snapshot of this page** check box) are recommended.
3.  Click **Send Feedback**:

## 4 Configuring the Widget in Your App Project

To configure the Mendix Feedback Widget, follow these steps:

1. Open the widget **Properties** by double-clicking the widget on the page. 
2. Select the **User** entity that is used in your application to store the name and email address of the user. Note that this object must be a specialization of the **User** entity within the **System** module (for example, **Account** in the **Administration** module).
3. Select the **Username attribute** that stores the name of the user and the **Email address attribute**. This will be used to automatically fill in the name and email address of the user who is logged in when submitting feedback in the app.
4.  Decide whether you want to allow users to upload a file and screenshot to the feedback item (via **Allow file upload** and **Allow screenshot upload**, respectively).

5.  Open the **Configuration** tab of the widget properties.
6.  Ensure that the **Feedback server** is set to `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/`.
7.  Ensure that the **Project identifier** is filled in correctly. The project identifier is your **App ID**, and it is automatically filled in for the Mendix Feedback Widget. If necessary, you can find the identifier of your app in the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) by opening your app and clicking **General** under the **Settings** category:

8.  If you have configured multiple home pages for different user roles, you need to add the Mendix Feedback Widget to each home page for the user role from which you want to gather feedback. This can easily be done by copying the configured widget to the other relevant layouts and pages.
