The Mendix Feedback & Collaboration Widget enables you to collaborate more easily and quickly then ever before when developing an app project.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Use the widget for leaving feedback on an app, editing an app, get a mobile view of an app, and sharing an app
* Add the widget to your app project
* Configure the Widget

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Create an app containing a working application model

## 3 Using the Widget

The Mendix Feedback & Collaboration Widget can be used in a variety of ways, which are described below.

### 3.1 Submitting Feedback on an App

When you click the **Feedback** icon, the platform first checks if you are signed in. If you are already signed in, you will be in **Feedback Mode** right away. If you are not signed in, you will need to either **Sign in to Mendix** or **Continue as a guest** to enter the feedback mode:

Once you are in feedback mode, you can click anywhere on the screen to leave a comment:

And voila! A screenshot is created automatically of the current page, which you can choose to attach to your feedback. After clicking **Send**, your feedback will go straight to the **Feedback** page of your app project in the Developer Portal. For more information, see [Feedback](index).

When you are done leaving feedback, you need to exit the feedback mode by clicking this button:

You can add as many email addresses as you like and email your app to colleagues for further collaboration and feedback.

## 4 Adding & Configuring the Widget

You should use the latest version of the Mendix Feedback & Collaboration widget, as it will provide the most up-to-date features for leaving feedback and communicating with the App Team.

The sections below describe how to make sure you have the latest version of the widget installed and how to configure the widget in your app project.

### 4.1 Adding the Widget to Your App Project

To ensure you have the latest version of the widget included in your app, follow these steps:

1.  Download the latest version of the [Mendix Feedback Widget](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/199/) from the App Store (as accessed through the Desktop Modeler).

2.  When the latest widget is included in your app, you need to ensure that the widget is added to the homepage of the application. Open the homepage from your app's **Project** > **Navigation**:
