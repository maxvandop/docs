## 2 General

The **General** tab displays an overview of the app's information: the name and description of the app, the **App Contact**, the **Technical Contact** (if the app has a node), whether the **Web Modeler** is enabled for the app, the **App ID**.

For more information, see [General Settings](general-settings).

## 3 Security

In **Security** there are two tabs with app and node permissions described below:

### 3.1 App Team

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Note that to view the **App Team**, you must have the **App Settings** permission or a default **Scrum Master** role.
{{% /alert %}}

The **App Team** tab lets you view and delete the team members that are currently working on the app. Each member has a **Role**. You can change the role of each team member to the following:

* Application Operator
* Business Engineer
* End-User
* Performance Engineer
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master

There are two actions you can take:

*   Change the **Role Settings**
*   View the **Change log**

### 3.2 Node Permissions

{{% alert type="info" %}}

**Node Permissions** are only available for Licensed Apps.

{{% /alert %}}

The **Node Permissions** tab lets you view the team members that have the **App Team** permission to **View Deploy and Monitor** the node. A **Technical Contact** can grant those team members the following permissions:

* Transport rights
* Access to backup
* Receive Alerts
* API rights
* Access to monitoring

For more information, see [Security-Node](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions).

## 4 API Keys
